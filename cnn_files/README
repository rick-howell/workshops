We will need to make a virtual environment
Because pytorch needs a specific version of numpy

Run the following lines in a bash terminal:

$ py -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/Scripts/activate
$ pip install torch torchvision


# Note, torch / torchvision automatically install correct versions of numpy and pillow

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #


Then we can run the code by opening a terminal and cd-ing into the cnn directory
Then we can run the code with the following command

$ py nameofcode.py


If the above doesn't work, run it from the script directly:

$ .venv/Scripts/python nameofcode.py
